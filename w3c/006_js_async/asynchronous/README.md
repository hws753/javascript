"I will finish later!"

Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous

A good example is JavaScript setTimeout()

Callback Alternatives
With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in parallel.

But, asynchronus programmes are difficult to write and difficult to debug.

Because of this, most modern asynchronous JavaScript methods don't use callbacks. Instead, in JavaScript, asynchronous programming is solved using Promises instead.
